MHF4U challenge problem but we took it wayyy too far

> Consider the digits 2, 0, 1, and 9.
> Using each digit only once, create a formula which generates all positive integers from 1 to 100.
> Any mathematical operator is allowed, including concatenation of digits.

### Status:
- :black_large_square: Simple solution for 0-100
- :white_check_mark: General solution for all real integers
- :white_check_mark: General solution for all real rationals
- :white_check_mark: General solution for all complex integers
- :white_check_mark: General solution for all complex rationals
